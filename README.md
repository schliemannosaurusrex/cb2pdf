# cbr2pdf

Comic book archive to PDF converter written for linux bash.

I'm not sure if the scripts run perfectly on all platforms, but it won't be so much effort to adapt or improve them to make 'em work everywhere.

I'm using Linux Mint and will keep it compatible with it.

## Prerequisites
You need to install following packages:
  ```img2pdf pdftk tree unrar unzip```

## Usage

Just run ```convertComicBookArchives2Pdf.sh``` in the folder containing the [*.cbr |*.cbz].

A PDF formatted copy of the file (including the name) with ending *.cb[r|z].pdf will be copied to the original folder.
